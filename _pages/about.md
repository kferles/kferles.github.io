### About Me

I am a Principal Scientist at [Veridise, Inc](https://veridise.com/),
where our goal is to harden blockchain security with formal methods. I
am also excited to announce that in Fall of 2023 I will be joining the
[Computer Science and Engineering
Department](https://www.cse.msu.edu/) at Michigan State University as
an Assistant Professor.

**If you are interested in working with me, consider applying to our
[Ph.D. program](https://www.cse.msu.edu/Students/Future_Grad/HowToApply.php)
and feel free to [contact me](mailto:kferles@cs.utexas.edu) in
advance.**

I received my Ph.D. from the University of Texas, Austin (UT Austin)
in December 2020. After graduating, I extended my stay at UT Austin
for a brief postdoc position (until May of 2021). All my years at UT,
I was working under the supervision of [Işıl
Dillig](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~isil/) and was a member of the
[UToPiA](https://utopia.cs.utexas.edu/) group. Prior to UT Austin, I
received my B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees (both in C.S.)  from the
University of Athens, Greece. During my master's, I was working as a
research assistant under the supervision of [Yannis
Smaragdakis](http://yanniss.github.io/).

### Research Interests

The goal of my research is to aid developers in writing correct and
efficient code by using a combination of program analysis and program
synthesis techniques. You can find a complete list of my publications
[here](/publications).

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
