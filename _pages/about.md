### About Me

I am Postdoctoral Fellow at the Computer Science Department in the
University of Texas, Austin (UT Austin). I am working under the
supervision of [Işıl Dillig](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~isil/) and I
am a member of the [UToPiA](https://utopia.cs.utexas.edu/) group. I
received my Ph.D. from UT Austin in December of 2020 while also
working under the supervision of [Işıl
Dillig](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~isil/). Prior to UT Austin, I
received my B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees (both in C.S.) from the University
of Athens, Greece. During my master's, I was working as a research
assistant under the supervision of [Yannis
Smaragdakis](http://yanniss.github.io/).

### Research Interests

The goal of my research is to aid developers in writing correct and
efficient code by using a combination of program analysis and program
synthesis techniques. You can find a complete list of my publications
[here](/publications).

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
